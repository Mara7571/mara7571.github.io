				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1vh;">General</h3> <br>
				<p style="font-size: x-large">Los Angeles is a sprawling city in Southern California and the center of
					the American film and television industry. Not far from the legendary Hollywood sign, studios such
					as Paramount Pictures, Universal and Warner Brothers offer tours of their sets. The TCL Chinese
					Theater on Hollywood Boulevard features the hand and footprints of famous actors, while the Walk of
					Fame honors thousands of Hollywood greats and vendors offer maps of star and celebrity homes.</p>

				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1vh;">History</h3> <br>
				<p style="font-size: x-large">The city was officially founded by Spanish governor Felipe de Neve on
					September 4, 1781 as El Pueblo de la Reina de Los Ángeles. The name thus referred to Mary as Queen
					of the Angels, a Marian title derived from the
					Litany of Lauretania. Today's name Los Angeles is a shortening of the founding name to "the angels".
					The unofficial name El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles del Río de Porciúncula. He
					makes
					specific reference to the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Assisi, built over the Portiuncula
					chapel where Francis of Assisi died. He was the founder of the order that included the missionaries
					who came to America with the explorers.
					The abbreviation frequently (also colloquially) used is "L.A.". Because of the Spanish meaning of
					the city name, the city is nicknamed the City of Angels.</p>

				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1vh;">Geographical location</h3> <br>
				<p style="font-size: x-large">Los Angeles' downtown and suburbs sit in a hilly coastal region averaging
					100 meters above sea level. To the west and south, the city borders the Santa Monica Bay of the
					Pacific Ocean. It is surrounded by mountain ranges to the east and north. Also north of the city is
					the San Fernando Valley, where a third of residents live in single-family homes. The valley is
					bounded by Griffith Park and the Santa Monica Mountains from Hollywood and downtown.</p>

				<p  style="font-size: x-large">The climate of Los Angeles is mild to hot year-round, and mostly dry. It is classified as a Mediterranean 
				   climate, which is a type of dry subtropical climate. It is characterized by seasonal changes in rainfall—with a dry summer 
				   and a winter rainy season. Under the modified Köppen climate classification, the coastal areas are classified as Csb, 
				   and the inland areas as Csa. <br> The Los Angeles area contains microclimates, where daytime temperatures can 
				   vary as much as 36 °F (20 °C) between inland areas such as the San Fernando Valley or San Gabriel Valley, 
				   and the coastal Los Angeles Basin.</p>
